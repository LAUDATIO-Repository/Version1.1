<p>Metadata and Research Data Documentation</p>
<p>A detailed and full documentation of the preparation and annotation process including a bibliographic list of the digitized texts is an important step towards improving the quality and thus the usability of historical linguistic corpus data: Such a documentation includes a description of the corpus design, the proper references of authors and editors of the corpus and the annotation, including formats and methods of quality assurance such as measuring Inter-Coder Agreement. Thus, the documentation covers document description as well as object description. Additionally, for (re-)use of the linguistic digital research data the aforementioned information is essential in order to add annotations or new texts to already existing corpora, or in order to use them as a template for "best practices" in building a new corpus. The required information will be provided by the customization of a TEI Header with an ODD specification along with a RELAX NG schema. Metadata must capture the entire life cycle of historical linguistic data.</p>
