What is meant by research data in historical corpus linguistics?Historical corpus linguistic research data consists of digitized text material, transcriptions of historical texts and linguistic annotation - a linguistic corpus. It is varied, often idiosyncratic depending on the research question and the language investigated, e.g. standard versus non-standard varieties of a language. Linguistic annotations of all kinds such as morpho-syntactic, syntactic, pragmatic and semantic annotation are seen as a crucial and essential part of a corpus in themselves. However, every single corpus built for a single research question may be used for another one as well. A collection of historical corpora from different periods may be even more useful, for example in order to trace diachronic language change phenomena over a long period. For this academic discipline, it would be a big advantage if such corpora, which are prepared in one way or another, are accessible and (re-)usable for all corpus linguists dealing with similar historical language data.
